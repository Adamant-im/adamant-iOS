Also, Blockchain provides new possibilities. You can store and transfer cryptos In-Chat with full control of your private keys, use ADAMANT as 2FA and more.\n\nIn ADAMANT, nobody can control, block, deactivate, restrict or censor accounts. Users take full responsibility for content, messages, media, and goals and intentions of using the Messenger.\n\nRemember, your security and anonymity is up to you. Do not follow links you receive, otherwise your IP can be compromised. Set a password on your device. Learn more about security and anonymity at https://adamant.im/staysecured/.\n\nMake sure you've saved the passPhrase for this account — logout and login again. Write your passPhrase on a sheet of paper as well. Only **you are responsible for passPhrase safety**. It cannot be recovered. And if other person will get it, your tokens will be stolen and correspondence read. Treat this question with outmost importance, as if tokens in your wallet will cost a billion dollars some time.\n\nTo start messaging now, **get free welcome tokens** on Account tab.

No external calls. Fetch is initiated by iOS, the actual time determined by the operating system based on many factors like battery charge, cellular network, application usage patterns and cannot be predicted. It can be 20 minutes, or 6 hours, or maybe even a day. You still can open app and check for a new message though.\n\n#### Push\nNotifications sent to your device by ADAMANT Notification Service. You will receive notification almost instantly after a message was sent and approved by the Blockchain — a few seconds delay. But this mode requires your device to register it's Device Token in the Service's database. Device tokens are safe and secure, and this option is recommended in most cases.\n\nYou can read more about device registration on ADAMANT's Github page.\n\n";
